Good value for money
Would recommend when in transit .
I enjoyed the central location ; it was very near to the Barcelona's main touristic street La Rambla .
Best hotel we have been to !
The hotel was a little bit shabby on first appearances but the room was absolutely fine !
It is beautifully painful to watch you.
Bar staff is friendly ( probably students ) .
The hotel is very very very very very very very excellent .
Very comfortable bed and room with sea views .
Very nice hotel with good wellness facilities. the hotel is just a 15min walk from the city center .
Spacious room and modern style ( not old like in other polish hotel )
Staff well prepared and kind .
Spoiled the impression of the trip
